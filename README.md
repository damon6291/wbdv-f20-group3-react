Descriptions:
Our Application aims to analyze and chart a users music data in order to provide more in depth information and build better catered playlists for each individual user that could be shared. This will provide a social media space for music conversing as well as a platform for musical data analysis.

One type of user that would use our platform would be a music enthusiast who would like to visualize their data and try to listen to more personalized suggestions based on their data, and then share and find new music on the social aspect.

Another type of user would be a social media artist who would like to gather a following by sharing their playlists to a wider audience, see the amount of followers, likes, shares on their playlists, etc.

We intend to solve this issue by fetching users info through spotify, and apple music, and then use an algorithm to breakdown and analyze the musical information such as genre, producers, and other distinct data. We will then chart the data for the user, as well as provide the ability to create a playlist that will fetch songs most closely aligned to the users data preferences. From there the user can share that playlist to a social media section available, or they can search through the social media section and converse with others/listen to others playlist/song recommendations. It is important for sites like these to have a good aesthetic so we plan on getting users through a clean and easy user UI but also with some animation in order to make it feel more modern.

We plan on using the Spotify and Apple web APIâ€™s in order to gather users data and to search for songs using certain parameters in order to build the curated playlists.
